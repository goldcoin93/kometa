# Kometa Config
Special thanks to many people in Kometa discord! Also, I'd like to particularly thank bullmose and Mr. Carrot who have helped me tremendously with all my support needs. 
The current configuration was inspired (and copied from) by other people's work: bullmose, solen, kaden, and JJJonesJr3)

## Important Notes

:white_check_mark::white_check_mark: <h3>**THIS REPOSITORY WILL NOT BE UPDATED MOVING FORWARD**</h3>:white_check_mark::white_check_mark:

I have decided to take a different approach and organize my Plex differently. New version found [here](https://github.com/goldcoin93/kometa-new)

Configuration files are based on NIGHTLY version.

:warning::warning:**Do keep in mind that this config will download all the pics from URL and place them into the `assets` folder. Part of the settings configuration below:**:warning::warning:
```
asset_depth: 1
create_asset_folders: true
prioritize_assets: true
dimensional_asset_rename: false
download_url_assets: true
```
Make sure to review all the `settings` in the config.yaml file.
If you'd like to understand more about these attributes, visit the [wiki](https://metamanager.wiki/en/nightly/config/settings/). 

## Config

The config file is incomplete. It's missing all the connections to Radarr, Webhooks, Trakt, etc.

Movies are separated into different collections:

### Actors and Directors

Images are taken mostly from ThePosterDB. Make sure to check the actors.yml and directors.yml files within the collections folder. Actors and Directors can be added following the same template.

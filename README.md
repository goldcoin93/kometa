# Kometa Config
Special thanks to many people in PMM discord! Also, I'd like to particularly thank bullmose and Mr. Carrot who have helped me tremendously with all my support needs. 
The current configuration was inspired (and copied from) by other people's work: bullmose, solen, kaden, and JJJonesJr3)

## Important Notes

Configuration files are based on NIGHTLY version.

This is a work in progress!! Readme is still incomplete! Updates will happen regurlarly!

Do keep in mind that this config will download all the pics from URL and place them into the `assets` folder. Part of the settings configuration below:
```
asset_depth: 1
create_asset_folders: true
prioritize_assets: true
dimensional_asset_rename: false
download_url_assets: true
```
Make sure to review all the `settings` in the config.yaml file.
If you'd like to understand more about these attributes, visit the [wiki](https://metamanager.wiki/en/nightly/config/settings/).

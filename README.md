# Kometa Config
Special thanks to many people in Kometa discord! Also, I'd like to particularly thank bullmose and Mr. Carrot who have helped me tremendously with all my support needs. 
The current configuration was inspired (and copied from) by other people's work: bullmose, solen, kaden, and JJJonesJr3)

## Important Notes

Configuration files are based on NIGHTLY version.

This is a work in progress!! Readme is still incomplete! Updates will happen regurlarly!

Do keep in mind that this config will download all the pics from URL and place them into the `assets` folder. Part of the settings configuration below:
```
asset_depth: 1
create_asset_folders: true
prioritize_assets: true
dimensional_asset_rename: false
download_url_assets: true
```
Make sure to review all the `settings` in the config.yaml file.
If you'd like to understand more about these attributes, visit the [wiki](https://metamanager.wiki/en/nightly/config/settings/). 

## Config

The config file is incomplete. It's missing all the connections to Radarr, Webhooks, Trakt, etc.

## Movies

Movies are separated into different categories:

### Actors and Directors

Images are taken mostly from ThePosterDB. Make sure to check the actors.yml and directors.yml files within the collections folder. Actors and Directors can be added following the same template.
